**Data Processing and Feature Selection:**

For the feature selection, I started by dropping columns with a low correlation (< 0.4) with SalePrice. I then dropped columns with low variances (< 1). After that, I checked the correlation matrix between columns to drop selected columns that have a correlation greater than 0.5 but with consideration for domain knowledge. After that, I checked for NAs in the numerical columns. Then, based on the result, I used domain knowledge to fill the NAs with appropriate values. In this case, I used 0 to fill the NAs as it was the most relevant value. As for the categorical NAs, they were replaced with ‚ÄòNone‚Äô. Once, all the NAs were taken care of, I used LabelEncoder to encode the categorical values. I, then, checked for a correlation between columns and dropped them based on domain knowledge.

Here are the 10 features I selected:

 'OverallQual': Overall material and finish quality
 
 'YearBuilt': Original construction date
 
 'TotalBsmtSF': Total square feet of basement area
 
 'GrLivArea': Above grade (ground) living area square feet
 
 'MasVnrArea': Masonry veneer area in square feet
 
 'BsmtFinType1': Quality of basement finished area
 
 'Neighborhood': Physical locations within Ames city limits
 
 'GarageType': Garage location
 
 'SaleCondition': Condition of sale
 
 'BsmtExposure': Walkout or garden-level basement walls

All the attributes are encoded and normalized before splitting into train and test with 80% train and 20% test.

**Milestone 2:**

For milestone 2, I used an XGBoost Model with objective="reg:squarederror" and max_depth=3. The RMSE score is 28986.

**Milestone 3:**

For milestone 3, I used a light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) with default parameters for baseline and hyperparameter-tuned with Optuna for the optimized model. The results are stated at the beginning of my readme file. I also hyperparameter-tuned my milestone-2 XGBoost model.

I tested the pickled models in this notebook: https://github.com/aye-thuzar/CS634Project/blob/main/CS634Project_Milestone3_AyeThuzar_Testing.ipynb

For the sliders of the categorical features in the app, the numbers and the corresponding meanings are described here: https://github.com/aye-thuzar/CS634Project/edit/main/docs.md
